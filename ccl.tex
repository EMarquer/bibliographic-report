To conclude this report, we have justified our perspective on why we are focusing to use DAN architecture on both LANL dataset and PAPUD industrial dataset.
First, we have tried to give a brief introduction about the different state of the art neural network architectures that can be used in our model, and have shown their major pros and cons for our project. Using this as a basis we explained the choice of DAN architecture before explaining its structure in more detail along with some potential ways to improve the performance of the DAN.
We have also illustrated the datasets we are using on our model. You can find a description of our current two implementations of the DAN on these dataset in the annex part of the report, \autopageref{annex}.
Hence, our main objective for the second half of the project would be to produce a very accurate line by line predictive model most likely based on DAN and to test it on our two datasets.
